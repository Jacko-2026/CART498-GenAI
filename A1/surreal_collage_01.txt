Floating Desert with Crystal Clouds
"Imagine a surreal desert landscape where the sand appears to float in mid-air,
suspended like a golden ocean of particles. Instead of a sun, a giant, translucent
crystal hovers overhead, casting shimmering, multi-colored reflections onto the
shifting dunes below. The sky is a swirling mix of lavender, teal, and orange, with
billowing clouds that appear to be made of delicate, shimmering glass, refracting
light in impossible angles. A lone figure, draped in flowing fabric, walks across the
floating sands, their footsteps leaving glowing imprints that disappear just as
quickly as they form."
