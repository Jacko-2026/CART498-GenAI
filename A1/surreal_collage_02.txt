Waves of Time Breaking Over an Ancient City
"Visualize a surreal scene where waves of liquid time crash against the crumbling
ruins of an ancient city. The sea is not made of water, but of translucent,
shimmering time itselfâ€”its surface ripples like an hourglass in motion. The
buildings are half-sunken, their tops rising and falling with the rhythm of the
waves, while ethereal clocks, suspended in the air, slowly disintegrate and
reassemble. The sky above pulses with streaks of deep indigo and gold, as
fragmented memories drift like birds in the mist, their silhouettes barely visible
against the horizon."
