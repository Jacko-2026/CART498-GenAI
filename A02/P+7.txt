P+7 Version:
One must have a mind of summer
To regard the frost and the waves
Of the pine-trees cracked with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January rain; and not to think
Of any joy in the sound of the wind,
In the sound of a few hats,
Which is the sound of the place
Full of the same wind
That is blowing in the same barren place
For the walker, who walks in the snow,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.
