P+40 Version:
One must have a mind of dog
To regard the frost and the windows
Of the pine-trees shiny with noise;
And have been warm a long time
To behold the bananas shagged with love,
The hedgehogs rough in the distant spider
Of the crocodile sky; and not to think
Of any bread in the sound of the cactus,
In the sound of a few cats,
Which is the sound of the forest
Full of the same giraffe
That is spinning in the same tiny place
For the chicken, who hops in the snow,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not here and the nothing that is.
